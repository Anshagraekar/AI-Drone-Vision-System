# 🚁 AI-Based Drone Vision System

An AI-powered Computer Vision system that performs **real-time object detection**, **monocular depth estimation**, and **3D spatial mapping** using a single RGB camera. The project combines YOLO object detection with MiDaS depth estimation to generate an approximate spatial representation of the surrounding environment, making it suitable for drone navigation, robotics, surveillance, and obstacle awareness applications.

## Camera Configuration

By default, the project uses your computer's webcam:

VIDEO_PATH = 0

To use DroidCam or an IP Webcam, replace it with your stream URL:

VIDEO_PATH = "http://<your-ip>:4747/video"

## 📊 Current Capabilities

- Detects multiple objects in real time
- Estimates approximate depth using a monocular RGB camera
- Generates a real-time 3D spatial blueprint
- Calculates approximate distances between detected objects
- Supports CPU-based execution without requiring a dedicated GPU
- Optimized for low-resource hardware through threaded processing and asynchronous inference

---

## 🔄 Future Improvements

- Full SAHI integration for enhanced small-object detection
- Object tracking with trajectory visualization
- Obstacle avoidance and collision warning system
- Dynamic occupancy grid mapping
- Real-world camera calibration for improved metric depth estimation
- SLAM integration for large-scale environment mapping

---

## ⚠️ Limitations

- Uses monocular depth estimation, which provides approximate rather than LiDAR-level metric accuracy.
- Distance estimation may vary depending on lighting conditions, camera calibration, and scene complexity.
- Performance is optimized for CPU execution but improves significantly with GPU acceleration.
